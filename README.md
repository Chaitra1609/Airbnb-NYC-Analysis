- **SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)** ‚Äì Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis  
- **Power BI** ‚Äì Interactive visualizations and dashboards  
- **Excel / CSV** ‚Äì Data preprocessing and initial exploration

## üìà SQL Queries Used  
Below are some of the key SQL queries used in this project:  

-- 1. Find the most popular hosts with the highest number of listings
SELECT host_id, host_name, COUNT(*) AS total_listings
FROM airbnb_listings
GROUP BY host_id, host_name
ORDER BY total_listings DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 2. Average price per neighborhood
SELECT neighbourhood, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM airbnb_listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood
ORDER BY avg_price DESC;

-- 3. Top-rated listings using RANK() function
SELECT listing_id, name, neighbourhood, avg_rating,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY neighbourhood ORDER BY avg_rating DESC) AS rank
FROM airbnb_listings
WHERE avg_rating IS NOT NULL;

-- 4. Total reviews per borough
SELECT neighbourhood_group, SUM(number_of_reviews) AS total_reviews
FROM airbnb_listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood_group
ORDER BY total_reviews DESC;

-- 5. Listings count by room type
SELECT room_type, COUNT(*) AS listing_count
FROM airbnb_listings
GROUP BY room_type
ORDER BY listing_count DESC;

-- 6. Filter listings with non-null ratings
SELECT *
FROM airbnb_listings
WHERE avg_rating IS NOT NULL;

-- 7. Find the top 5 highest revenue-generating listings (assuming revenue = price * number_of_reviews)
SELECT listing_id, name, host_name, price, number_of_reviews, (price * number_of_reviews) AS revenue
FROM airbnb_listings
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
