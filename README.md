## \ud83d\udcc8 SQL Queries Used  
Below are some of the key SQL queries used in this project:  

### 1. Find the Most Popular Hosts with the Highest Number of Listings  
```sql
SELECT host_id, host_name, COUNT(*) AS total_listings
FROM airbnb_listings
GROUP BY host_id, host_name
ORDER BY total_listings DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Average Price per Neighborhood  
```sql
SELECT neighbourhood, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM airbnb_listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood
ORDER BY avg_price DESC;
```

### 3. Top-Rated Listings Using RANK() Function  
```sql
SELECT listing_id, name, neighbourhood, avg_rating,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY neighbourhood ORDER BY avg_rating DESC) AS rank
FROM airbnb_listings
WHERE avg_rating IS NOT NULL;
```

### 4. Total Reviews per Borough  
```sql
SELECT neighbourhood_group, SUM(number_of_reviews) AS total_reviews
FROM airbnb_listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood_group
ORDER BY total_reviews DESC;
```

### 5. Listings Count by Room Type  
```sql
SELECT room_type, COUNT(*) AS listing_count
FROM airbnb_listings
GROUP BY room_type
ORDER BY listing_count DESC;
```

### 6. Filter Listings with Non-Null Ratings  
```sql
SELECT *
FROM airbnb_listings
WHERE avg_rating IS NOT NULL;
```

### 7. Find the Top 5 Highest Revenue-Generating Listings  
(Assuming revenue = price * number_of_reviews)
```sql
SELECT listing_id, name, host_name, price, number_of_reviews, (price * number_of_reviews) AS revenue
FROM airbnb_listings
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
